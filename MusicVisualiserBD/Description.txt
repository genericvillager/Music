We aimed to have a continuous theme of space.
- The music was compiled from Gustav Holst’s ‘The Planets’,
James Rutland’s ‘Dystopia Infiltration - Futuristic Orchestral Music’,
and snippets from space launch announcements.

What your assignment does:
- The spaceship flames, spaceship, ship UI (bar at bottom of screen),
and rectangles (at the end) all react to the music.

- The visual accompanying the audio is to complement the theme of the music.
- The visual is set in space and shows the spaceship from take-off,
past the planet of our solar system, through an asteroid belt,
and finally through an alien area of strangely reactive squares.

What the controls are
- As it is a music visualiser, there are no controls.

How to make it run
- Simply press play in processing.
- Minim may need to be downloaded.

A list of the stuff you are most proud of. This will help me to grade the assignments.
- Creating a timer that counts up to 99 minutes.
- Creating the asteroid code.
- Creating audio-reactive squares with colour that is also affected by the audio.
